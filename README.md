# FarmDash

## Objective

Develop an interface that displays information and graphs that summarize cow and herd productive and economic performance based on parameters measured by sensors and market conditions. The goal is to integrate and display productive and economic data that affects profitability of dairy cows and herds and can be used to monitor individual cows or the whole herd in real time. Ideally, it will be possible to use current and historical data to project economic performance.
